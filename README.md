# challenge-3
password generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to make a password generator between 8 and 128 characters. It solves the problem of making a unique random password generator. From doing research it seems like there are a multitude of ways to do this and some are more secure than others. For instance, some ways offer encryption and others do not.

## installation

you just need a web browser to use this password generator.
